# Implementation Notes

## Overview

This Python tool processes SQL Server database geometry fields (LINESTRING type) to simplify coordinate data by removing redundant collinear points while preserving the geometric shape.

## Verification Checklist

All requirements from the ticket have been implemented:

### ✅ Database Connection
- [x] Connects to SQL Server using pyodbc
- [x] Uses configuration from `config/config.yml`
- [x] Supports configurable server, username, password, database

### ✅ Data Processing
- [x] Reads geometry data from specified table and field
- [x] Parses LINESTRING WKT format correctly
- [x] Skips records with exactly 5 points (no update needed)
- [x] Processes records with more than 5 points
- [x] Handles records with fewer than 5 points (logs warning, skips)

### ✅ Simplification Algorithm
- [x] Implements collinearity detection using cross product method
- [x] Configurable tolerance for collinearity detection
- [x] Removes redundant middle points on straight lines
- [x] Preserves endpoints
- [x] Ensures closed ring (first point = last point)
- [x] Targets 5-point closed quadrilateral

### ✅ Database Updates
- [x] Updates geometry field using STGeomFromText
- [x] Preserves SRID from configuration
- [x] Updates by primary key (gid)
- [x] Commits all changes after processing

### ✅ Configuration File
- [x] YAML format in `config/config.yml`
- [x] Contains all database connection parameters
- [x] Contains table and field names
- [x] Contains SRID value
- [x] Contains algorithm parameters (target points, tolerance)
- [x] Well documented with comments

### ✅ Logging
- [x] Creates logs directory automatically if not exists
- [x] Filename format: `geometry_process_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- [x] Log format matches requirements
- [x] Logs each record's processing start
- [x] Logs point counts
- [x] Logs skip/update decisions
- [x] Logs number of removed points
- [x] Shows processing progress (current/total, percentage)
- [x] Logs exceptions with full traceback
- [x] Outputs to both file and console

### ✅ Additional Features
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] Type hints throughout
- [x] Detailed docstrings
- [x] Example script for testing without database
- [x] Comprehensive README documentation
- [x] requirements.txt for dependencies
- [x] Updated .gitignore for Python files and logs

## Test Run

The example script was successfully tested with the sample data from the ticket:

**Input:** 7 points  
**Output:** 5 points  
**Removed:** 2 collinear middle points (points 3 and 4)

This confirms the algorithm correctly identifies and removes redundant points while preserving the geometric shape.

## Files Created

1. **config/config.yml** - Configuration file with all settings
2. **scripts/geometry_processor.py** - Main processing script
3. **scripts/requirements.txt** - Python dependencies
4. **scripts/README.md** - Comprehensive documentation
5. **scripts/example_usage.py** - Example/test script
6. **scripts/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md** - This file

## Files Modified

1. **.gitignore** - Added Python and log file patterns
2. **README.md** - Added reference to Python tool

## Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure database settings
# Edit config/config.yml with your actual database details

# Run the processor
python geometry_processor.py
```

## Notes

- The SRID in the configuration defaults to 4326 (WGS84). This should be changed to match the actual SRID in your database.
- The collinearity tolerance can be adjusted based on coordinate system and desired precision.
- The tool automatically creates the logs directory if it doesn't exist.
- All processing is logged both to file and console for real-time monitoring.
- The example script can be used to test the algorithm without a database connection.

## Dependencies

- **pyodbc**: SQL Server database connectivity
- **PyYAML**: YAML configuration file parsing
- **Python 3.7+**: Required for modern type hints and features

## Database Driver

Requires ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server (or later). Installation instructions are provided in the README.md file.
